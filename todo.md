Features to be implemented:
- ~~add pathway neighbors heatmaps to TCGA data~~
- ~~add shortcuts to regenerate manuscript figures~~
- ~~add more usage description -- app function is not very intuitive~~
  - ~~e.g. spell out 'IPL'~~
- ~~convert sub-menu 'pathway' and 'protein' into radio buttons~~
  - radio button indicate input value, sub-menu indicate a webpage
- ~~auto-size heatmaps upon the number of input pathways/proteins~~
- ~~is it possible to utilize ShinyLive to make this app independent of a Shiny server?~~
  - deployed at https://biostat.wisc.edu/~pliu/shinylive/site/
  - but got error: 'Robj construction for this JS object is not yet supported'
  - known issue: https://github.com/posit-dev/shinylive/issues/98
