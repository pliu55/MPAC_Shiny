Features to be implemented:
- ~~add pathway neighbors heatmaps to TCGA data~~
- add shortcuts to regenerate manuscript figures
- add more usage description -- app function is not very intuitive
  - ~~e.g. spell out 'IPL'~~
- ~~convert sub-menu 'pathway' and 'protein' into radio buttons~~
  - radio button indicate input value, sub-menu indicate a webpage
- auto-size heatmaps upon the number of input pathways/proteins
- is it possible to utilize ShinyLive to make this app independent of a Shiny server?
